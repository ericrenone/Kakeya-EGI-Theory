# Kakeya AGI Simulator — Streaming LLM Stick Bundles with Novelty-Gated Adaptive Learning


## Overview

The **Kakeya AGI Simulator** is a first-principles framework demonstrating how **emergent general intelligence** can arise from **deterministic streaming neural computation**. Multiple pre-trained LLMs are represented as **weight stick bundles**, processed in **fixed-point arithmetic**, and combined via **local novelty-gated adaptive learning**. The system uses **Kakeya-inspired geometric transformations** to span all high-dimensional representational directions.

This framework provides a conceptual and experimentally inspired demonstration of AGI:

- **Deterministic fixed-point execution**, mimicking FPGA or ASIC hardware implementations.  
- **Multi-LLM streaming**, combining SVD-derived principal components for emergent global behavior.  
- **Local novelty gates**, enabling adaptive, surprise-driven updates to activations.  
- **Kakeya geometric coverage**, ensuring maximal exploration of representational space.  
- **Interactive visualization**, showing activation evolution, sparsity distributions, and novelty gating in real time.

## System Architecture

### LLM Stick Bundles

Each LLM is decomposed into **principal component sticks** using SVD (Eckart–Young decomposition). The sticks:

- Represent high-dimensional weight directions as vectors.  
- Are streamed sequentially into the simulation pipeline.  
- Retain deterministic behavior under **quantized fixed-point execution**.  

### Fixed-Point Deterministic Execution

- All activations are **quantized** to simulate FPGA-style integer arithmetic.  
- Bit-exact computation ensures reproducibility of neural activations.  
- **Streaming datapaths** allow continuous activation processing with minimal control overhead.  

### Local Novelty-Gated Adaptive Learning

- Each LLM stick is locally modulated by a **novelty gate**, which triggers updates when activation changes exceed a threshold.  
- This mechanism simulates **adaptive plasticity**, where surprising signals lead to faster learning.  
- Supports emergent coordination across multiple LLM sticks without centralized control.  

### Kakeya Geometric Coverage

- Local stick activations are **rotated and combined** across multiple LLMs to approximate a **Kakeya set** in high-dimensional space.  
- Ensures that all possible directions in representation space are explored, maximizing **generalization potential**.  
- Combines **local novelty** with **global coverage**, allowing AGI-like emergent behavior.

### Real-Time Interactive Visualization

The simulator tracks:

- **Activation distributions** across all sticks.  
- **Sparsity evolution**, showing how many activations collapse to zero.  
- **Novelty gating events**, highlighting where local adaptation occurs.  
- **Global AGI state**, projected from all sticks using Kakeya-inspired rotations.  

These visualizations provide **instant feedback on emergent patterns** and system stability.
