# Kakeya AGI Simulator — Streaming LLM Stick Bundles with Novelty-Gated Adaptive Learning

---

## Overview

The **Kakeya AGI Simulator** is a **first-principles framework** demonstrating how **emergent general intelligence** can arise from **deterministic streaming neural computation**.  

Multiple pre-trained LLMs are represented as **weight stick bundles**, processed in **fixed-point arithmetic**, and combined via **local novelty-gated adaptive learning**. The system uses **Kakeya-inspired geometric transformations** to span all high-dimensional representational directions, enabling **maximal exploration of representational space**.

Key properties:

- **Deterministic fixed-point execution**, mimicking FPGA or ASIC hardware implementations.  
- **Streaming multi-LLM processing**, combining SVD-derived principal components sequentially.  
- **Local novelty gates**, enabling adaptive, surprise-driven updates to activations.  
- **Dynamic memory efficiency**, avoiding the memory wall by forming sticks on-the-fly rather than storing all simultaneously.

## System Architecture

### 1. LLM Stick Bundles
- Each LLM is decomposed into **principal component sticks** using **SVD (Eckart–Young decomposition)**.  
- Sticks represent **high-dimensional weight directions** and are **streamed sequentially** for deterministic processing.  
- This streaming allows the system to **form high-dimensional combinations dynamically**, reducing on-chip memory requirements.

### 2. Fixed-Point Deterministic Execution
- Uses **Q16.16 fixed-point arithmetic** to simulate FPGA/ASIC integer-only computation.  
- **Bit-exact computation** ensures reproducibility across platforms.  
- Streaming datapaths allow **continuous computation without a full memory footprint**.

### 3. Local Novelty-Gated Adaptive Learning
- **Novelty gates** trigger updates when activation directions deviate beyond a threshold.  
- Supports **adaptive plasticity**, scaling local learning rates dynamically.  
- Enables **coordination across LLM sticks without centralized memory storage**, reducing LUT/BRAM pressure.

### 4. Kakeya Geometric Coverage
- Rotating stick activations across multiple LLMs approximates a **Kakeya set** in high-dimensional space.  
- Guarantees **representational completeness**: every input can map to a high-dimensional direction.  
- Combines **local novelty** with **global coverage** for robust generalization, even with limited on-chip resources.

### 5. Hardware-Efficient Memory Strategy
- **Streaming computation** means sticks are **formed as they are processed**, avoiding static memory allocation for all vectors.  
- **BRAM/UltraRAM** stores only currently active sticks; LUTs handle rotations and projections dynamically.  
- Typical **80% BRAM / 20% LUT allocation** is ideal for balancing memory and combinatorial logic.  
- Current FPGA families (Xilinx UltraScale+, Alveo, Versal HBM) support this ratio, but **first-principles design allows smaller boards to experiment**.

## Real-Time Interactive Visualization
The simulator provides a **four-quadrant AGI analysis**:

1. **Entropy Dynamics** — density of information in streamed sticks.  
2. **Energy Evolution** — stability of SVD components.  
3. **Novelty Detections** — mapping “Aha!” moments in the data stream.  
4. **Adaptive Gain (α)** — system sensitivity to novelty in real time.
