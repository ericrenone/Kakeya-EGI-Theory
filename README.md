# Kakeya AGI — Streaming LLM Stick Bundles with Novelty-Gated Adaptive Learning

## Overview

The **Kakeya AGI** is a **first-principles framework** demonstrating how **emergent general intelligence** arises from **deterministic streaming neural computation**.  

- Multiple pre-trained LLMs are represented as **weight stick bundles**.  
- These sticks are **relationally defined and novelty-activated**: they exist only in response to new, surprising inputs.  
- Activations are processed in **fixed-point arithmetic**, combined via **local novelty-gated adaptive learning**, and projected using **Kakeya-inspired geometric transformations** to cover all high-dimensional directions.  

**Key conceptual breakthroughs:**

- **Memory-light computation:** Sticks exist only by relationship and are **activated only by novelty**.  
- **Deterministic fixed-point execution:** Mimics FPGA/ASIC hardware with bit-exact precision.  
- **Emergent general intelligence:** Global behavior emerges from **local, surprise-driven interactions**.  
- **Kakeya geometric coverage:** Ensures maximal exploration of representational space.

## System Architecture

### 1. LLM Stick Bundles — Exist Only by Relationship

- Each LLM is decomposed into **principal component sticks** via **SVD (Eckart–Young decomposition)**.  
- **Relational Activation:** Sticks are not static; they are **activated dynamically** when novelty is detected.  
- **Memory Efficiency:** Only a subset of sticks is active at any time, minimizing **BRAM/LUT usage**.  
- **Emergent Network:** Activated sticks form a **computational web of relationships**, not a static matrix.  

### 2. Fixed-Point Deterministic Execution

- Uses **Q16.16 fixed-point arithmetic** to simulate FPGA/ASIC integer computation.  
- **Bit-exact computation** guarantees reproducibility across platforms.  
- **Streaming datapaths** enable continuous processing with minimal control overhead.  

### 3. Local Novelty-Gated Adaptive Learning

- **Novelty gates** trigger updates when activation changes exceed a threshold.  
- Simulates **adaptive plasticity**, where the system learns faster from surprising inputs.  
- Supports **emergent coordination** across multiple sticks without centralized control.  

### 4. Kakeya Geometric Coverage

- Rotates and combines stick activations across multiple LLMs to approximate a **Kakeya set** in high-dimensional space.  
- **Representational completeness:** every input can map to some high-dimensional direction.  
- **Out-of-distribution generalization:** local novelty + global coverage ensures adaptive, AGI-like behavior.  

### 5. Real-Time Interactive Visualization

Tracks four axes of system dynamics:

1. **Entropy Dynamics:** Information density of the streams.  
2. **Energy Evolution:** Stability of SVD components.  
3. **Novelty Detections:** “Aha!” moments in the data stream.  
4. **Adaptive Gain (α):** Real-time sensitivity to new information.
